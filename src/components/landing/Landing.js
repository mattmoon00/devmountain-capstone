        Matt's Bistro is a family style restaurant offering exceptional value to
        its guests through the many dishes of Southern Italian cuisine.
        Restaurateur Matt Moon crafted Matt's with a singular vision; bringing
        his guests “wow-factor” sized portions and making any meal feel like an
        Italian American wedding feast.

        Platters of homestyle antipasto, pasta, decadent seafood or meat
        entrees, and of course homemade desserts are all staples at Matt's,
        meant for sharing amongst friends and family. When great food and wine
        are supported by friendly and knowledgeable service, the results are
        magic - we want every day to feel like a Sunday afternoon at Grandma’s!

        Matt's first location opened August 14, 1990 at 2450 Broadway on the
        Upper West Side of Manhattan. The classic decor of this flagship Matt's
        evokes the image of marquee New York restaurants that made this city
        into what it is today. With elements drawn from America’s “Golden Age”,
        Matt's has the quintessential NYC feel, resonating with its customers
        and looking like it has always been a part of the Upper West Side- and
        always will be!

        The interior style at Matt's started a trend in Italian dining rooms
        around the country, and the eclectic, spirited environment has become
        the perfect place for family celebrations.

        The restaurant was an immediate hit. Long lines of hungry diners became
        a nightly occurrence on Upper Broadway as word got out that something
        exciting- and tasty- was happening. The great food spoke for itself, but
        customers also marveled at the huge portions available at reasonable
        prices.
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        Each dining experience was enhanced by the long lineup of cocktails
        spilling over the edge of enormous glasses, and a wine list featuring
        great value and a strong selection of varieties from Italy and the rest
        of the world. The Upper West Side could not get enough, and Matt's
        became the New York institution it is to this day.
